|  
|  The jshell tool provides line editing support to allow you to navigate within
|  and edit snippets and commands. The current command/snippet can be edited,
|  or prior commands/snippets can be retrieved from history, edited, and executed.
|  This support is similar to readline/editline with simple emacs-like bindings.
|  There are also jshell tool specific key sequences.
|
|  ...
```

You can try the following code snippets in `jshell`.

## :-1: ~326: Raw String Literals (Preview)~
Feature removed. For good.  
There are 2 leftovers in `String`:
### :confused: transform
How to rewrite this snippet
```java
Integer.parseInt( "65536" )
```
in overcomplicated and overweighted way?

Here you are:
```java
"65536".transform( Integer::parseInt )
```

### :confused: indent
Would you like to format your JSON?  
You are expecting too much from Java.
But you can adjust indentation:

```java
var jsonInner = "'name': 'OpenJDK',\n'version': 12\n".replace( '\'', '"' );
System.out.println( jsonInner );
var jsonOuter = "{\n" + jsonInner.indent( 4 ) + "}\n";
System.out.println( jsonOuter );
System.out.println( jsonOuter.indent( -8 ) );
```

## :disappointed: 325: Switch Expressions (Preview)

By using switch expressions with default configuration, you will see an error:
```
|  Error:
|  switch expressions are a preview feature and are disabled by default.
|    (use --enable-preview to enable switch expressions)
```

You have to enable this feature first:
```
/usr/lib/jvm/java-12-openjdk/bin/jshell --enable-preview
```

Then you can use it:
```java
String developerRating( int numberOfChildren ) {
    return switch (numberOfChildren) {
        case 0 -> "open source contributor";
        case 1 -> "junior";
        case 2 -> "senior";
        case 3 -> "expert";
        default -> {
            if (numberOfChildren < 0) throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException( numberOfChildren );
            break "manager";
        }
    };
}

developerRating( 0 ); // ==> "open source contributor"
developerRating( 4 ); // ==> "manager"
```

## Other extensions to the standard library
### CompactNumberFormat

#### :confused: Short variant

In IT we often use multiplicators, i.e. 1K, 1M, 1G, 1T, 1P, etc.  
It would be useful to have these multiplicators available out-of-the-box, right?

Let's try a new feature - `CompactNumberFormat` - to see, if it helps.

```java
import java.text.*;
var cnf = NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance();

cnf.format( 1L << 10 ); // ==> 1K
cnf.format( 1L << 20 ); // ==> 1M
cnf.format( 1L << 30 ); // ==> 1B - what?
cnf.format( 1L << 40 ); // ==> 1T
cnf.format( 1L << 50 ); // ==> 1126T
```

They are not, what you would expect - they are unicode formats :)  
Please see the official website for details: https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Compact_Number_Formats

#### :+1: Long variant

```java
import java.text.*;
var cnf = NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance( Locale.GERMAN, NumberFormat.Style.LONG )

cnf.format( 1L << 10 ); // ==> 1 Tausend
cnf.format( 1L << 20 ); // ==> 1 Million
cnf.format( 1L << 30 ); // ==> 1 Milliarde
cnf.format( 1L << 40 ); // ==> 1 Billion
cnf.format( 1L << 50 ); // ==> 1126 Billionen
```

### :confused: Files.mismatch

```java
Files.mismatch( Paths.get("doesn't exist"), Paths.get("doesn't exist") ); // ==> -1
```
gives result `-1` - means the 2 non existing files are equal.  
Is this what you would expect?

### :confused: Collectors.teeing

How to rewrite this snippet
```java
Stream.of( 2, 4, 8, 0x10 ).collect( Collectors.averagingInt( i -> i ) )
```
in overcomplicated and overweighted way?

Here you are:
```java
Stream.of( 2, 4, 8, 0x10 ).collect( Collectors.teeing( Collectors.summingDouble( i -> i ), Collectors.counting(), (s, c) -> s / c ) )
```

## :confused: 334: JVM Constants API
Maybe relevant for tools like Class Visualizer. Otherwise no added value.

Please don't be surprise by new super-interfaces added to some core classes - shown below  
(diagrams generated by [Class Visualizer](http://class-visualizer.net/)):

![Constable](diagrams/Constable.png "Constable")

![ConstantDesc](diagrams/ConstantDesc.png "ConstantDesc")

## :confused: 341: Default CDS Archives
Nothing new - unless you are building custom JRE images.

## :disappointed: 189: Shenandoah: A Low-Pause-Time Garbage Collector (Experimental)
Included in RedHat builds.  
You can find it in OpenJDK since v1.8.0 on RedHat Linux 7.x.

You can turn it on as follows:
```
java -XX:+UseShenandoahGC
```

:disappointed: Not included in the official build from Oracle.  
See this issue for details: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8215030

Try of turning it on leads to an error:
```
$ java -XX:+UseShenandoahGC
Error: VM option 'UseShenandoahGC' is experimental and must be enabled via -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions.

$ java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseShenandoahGC
Error occurred during initialization of VM
Option -XX:+UseShenandoahGC not supported
```

## 344: Abortable Mixed Collections for G1

## :disappointed: 346: Promptly Return Unused Committed Memory from G1
Made in :switzerland:  
:disappointed: switched off by default.

## :confused: 230: Microbenchmark Suite
## :confused: 340: One AArch64 Port, Not Two

# Leftovers from version 11
## :-1: JDK Mission Control 7
:-1: Still in Early-Acces phase, all builds are removed.
